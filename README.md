Smart Agriculture Advisor
AI-Powered Precision Farming Solution
Overview
Smart Agriculture Advisor is a data-driven solution that helps farmers optimize their agricultural practices using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). The system provides recommendations for crop selection, fertilizer usage, and disease detection to improve farming efficiency and productivity.

Key Features
Crop Recommendation â€“ Suggests the most suitable crop based on soil properties and weather conditions.
Fertilizer Recommendation â€“ Analyzes soil nutrient levels and recommends the appropriate fertilizer.
Disease Detection â€“ Identifies crop diseases from images and provides treatment suggestions.
Data-Driven Decision Making â€“ Uses AI models to analyze soil, climate, and crop health.
Data Sources
Crop Recommendation Dataset
Fertilizer Suggestion Dataset
Plant Disease Detection Dataset
Technology Stack
Backend & Frontend
Python (Flask)
HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Bootstrap)
Jinja2 for Template Rendering
Machine Learning & Deep Learning
NumPy, Pandas (Data Processing)
Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch (ML & DL Models)

How It Works
Crop Recommendation
Inputs: N-P-K values (Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potassium), temperature, humidity, pH level.
Output: Best crop suggestion for given soil conditions.
Fertilizer Suggestion
Inputs: Soil composition and crop type.
Output: Recommendation for improving soil quality with specific fertilizers.
Disease Detection
Input: Image of a diseased crop leaf.
Output: Identification of disease with treatment recommendations.
